        <p>In this project, we will collaborate to create an electronic health monitoring device, namely blood pressure monitoring watch and disease diagnosis. Perhaps blood pressure monitors are no stranger to every person in the 21st century, even now almost every family owns these devices for convenient health monitoring. Because of its popularity, the technologies to create this machine are also clearly revealed. Our team simply based on that research combined with our own skills to create a machine with more outstanding features. Realizing that the standard machines in the market are quite cumbersome and manual, we plan to integrate many new technologies into the machine such as websites, AI, chatbots, etc. and release a more perfect version. Our product aims to be compact, luxurious, modern and much easier to use. It will solve disease anxiety for all walks of life.</p>
        <p>As described, this machine has the main function of measuring the user's blood pressure and heart rate and giving a diagnosis of health status. The measuring device will be designed in a compact design that is easy to move like a watch or bracelet. The remarkable point of the project is the patient information storage website which combines the latest chatbot technology to inform the user in the most natural way. In addition to periodic blood pressure information, our website also allows users to declare other background medical information in their records. Then, the system will automatically base on the information obtained combined with medical knowledge to give the most accurate diagnosis. Thanks to automatic AI technology, users do not need to take notes in medical examination books anymore, just log in to their personal account and all medical information, as well as test results, will be notified. In the future, we also plan to develop the ability to automatically make diagnoses based on facial expression, voice, and blood. The whole process is equivalent to a general check-up in a hospital, but can be replaced by machines and home testing. This is a difficult and ambitious project, but with existing technologies and external assistants, we believe it can be accomplished.<p>

        <h3>Topic</h3>
        <p>During the Covid-19 situation in Vietnam and around the world, people are restricted from going out if they do not have the necessary reasons. It can be said that health is one of the priorities in this period because people need to take care of their health to live well. Blood pressure is one of the health issues that might be the leading cause of death in many circumstances. Moreover, doctors advise that citizens should go to the hospital on a regular basis for checkups because of a good health condition. Therefore, from the two points above, our project may bring many benefits for public health. Most importantly, this project will apply AI technology into our website to temporarily diagnose before the user can be able to meet direct doctors. AI is now becoming mainstream with many potential capacities. So, if our team successfully applies AI to this project, it will be helpful and convenient for not only patients but also doctors. Because we allow the system to print the user's health report and give it to doctors, it may lead the treatment process not too long.</p>
        <p>If our members implement this project, we will be able to work with A.I and get it as an experience. Nowadays, most companies are seriously interested in artificial intelligence, so, there are many opportunities for finding jobs in the future. Furthermore, this project combines hardware and websites, so we will know how to create and work smoothly with two of the systems.<p>
